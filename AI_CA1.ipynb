Gray Gandalf is tasked with confronting Sauron, the lord of darkness, with the goal of leading and guiding the ring fellows. To do this, he must pass the fellows of the ring through the eurekas, which are Sauron's army, and bring each one to a specific position, and at the end he goes to Gondor. "

    "### A* Algorithm\n",
    "This algorithm is very similar to `BFS` algorithm, but it uses a priority queue as it's frontier instead. The A* class \n",
    "has a frontier set that is implemented by min-heap queue that its indicator for choosing a node is the value of the evaluating\n",
    "function *f*. The argument of this function is a node and the return value of this function is sum of the path_cost of the node\n",
    "and the value of the heuristic function. At first we add intial state into frontier and then pop it from the queue. Then all possible actions from initial values which does not explored before, will add to the frontier and next we will redo these steps until we find goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Heuristic:\n",
    " \n",
    "- When all the Helpers have reached their destination, the heuristic is the Manhattan distance from Gandalf's current location to Gandalf's final destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When Gandalf picks a Helper to reach his destination, the heuristic is the Manhattan distance from Gandalf's current location to the destination of the Helper he picks, plus the Manhattan distance from the destination of the Helper he delivered to Gandalf's final destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When Gandalf has not selected a helper to reach his destination, the heuristic is the maximum of Manhattan distance of Gandalf's current location to the origin of any helper that has not reached its destination, plus the Manhattan distance from the origin of any remaining helper to its destination, plus the Manhattan distance from Helper's destination to Gandalf's final destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Amissiblity: \n",
    "This heuristic never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, because in the first case the heuristic is less than the actual distance to the destination, and in the second and third cases we have at least one Helper from there, and we only calculate the distance of one Helper. So again it is less than the actual distance.\n",

    "$$ cost(A to C) \\geq h(A) - h(C)$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Gandalf moves a Helper closer to the his destination:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Gandalf moves without moving any Helpers:\n",
    "    In this case the heusitics for state C and A are equal therfore the difference is equal to zero and the quation holds.\n",
    "    \n",

    "BFS can be fast in searching but the hold-up is that it's uninformed. Also BFS does not visit a state twice.\n",

    "*Advantages:*\n",
    "* The solution will definitely found out by BFS If there is some solution.\n",
    "* If there is more than one solution then it will find a solution with minimal steps.\n",
    "* BFS will never get trapped in a blind alley, which means unwanted nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disadvantages:*\n",
    "* If a solution is far away then it consumes time.\n",
    "* Memory Constraints As it stores all the nodes of the present level to go for the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS is optimal if cost = 1 per step (if the path cost is a nondecreasing function of the depth of the node)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IDS:\n",
    "IDS is much slower than the other search algorithms again one reason being that IDS is uninformed but it's main advantage is it's memory. It can operate with just a stack proportional to the depth of one branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages:*\n",
    "* When the solutions are found at the lower depths say n, then the algorithm proves to be efficient and in time.\n",
    "\n",

    "* The main problem with IDS is the time and wasted calculations that take place at each depth.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### A*:\n",
    "A* is a very fast search algorithm a good thing about is that A* is an informed search algorithm so this means it uses a heuristic function to search in the rational direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If h(n) is consistent, then the values of f(n) along any path are nondecreasing. Whenever A∗ selects a node n for expansion, the optimal path to that node has been found.\n",

    "If A* returns a solution, that solution is guaranteed to be optimal, as long as:\n",
    "* the branching factor is finite\n",
    "* arc costs are strictly positive\n",
    "* h(n) is an underestimate of the length of the shortest path from n to a goal node, and is non-negative\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted A*:\n",
    "Weighted A* is completely similar to A* but calculating f(n) is different. This difference will result in even faster search algorithm but the disadvantage can be missing the optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of Weighted A* is speed up search at the expense of optimality Take an admissible heuristic, “inflate” it by a multiple α > 1, and then perform A* search as usual. Fewer nodes tend to get expanded, but the resulting solution may be suboptimal (its cost will be at most α times the cost of the optimal solution)"
